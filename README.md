# Memories Application

This is a web application for creating and displaying memories. Users can add new memories and view existing ones. The Memories App is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create, edit, and delete memories, with a clean and intuitive user interface. The front end is developed using React with Material-UI for styling, and the back end is powered by Node.js and Express.js, connected to a MongoDB database.
